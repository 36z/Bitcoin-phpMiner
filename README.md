# Bitcoin phpMiner

phpMiner uses CPU and it is slower than normal CPU miner. I didn't know it untill I made it, but that wasn't the goal. The goal was to be able to mine on server without much trouble and to run this on for example a webhost.

Run test.php for testcase.
Look in work.php for example how to use.

I am open for improvements and feedback.
